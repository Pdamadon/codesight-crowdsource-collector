OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET=codesight-research-videos
AWS_S3_REGION=us-east-1
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
```

## Vercel Frontend Configuration
Set these through Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/codesight/frontend
2. Go to Settings > Environment Variables and add:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
```

## AWS S3 Configuration âœ… COMPLETED
- Bucket created: `codesight-research-videos`

## Next Steps
